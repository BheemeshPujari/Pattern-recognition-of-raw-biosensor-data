# Pattern Recognition for Biosensor Data using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to process raw data from biosensors. Biosensors are vital in applications like medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety. However, their data is often noisy and complex, making traditional signal processing challenging. This project leverages ML models to improve noise reduction, feature extraction, and decision-making in biosensor signal processing.

### Noise Reduction:
Wavelet Transform used for adaptive noise filtering.
Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for class imbalance correction.
### Dimensionality Reduction:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) implemented to capture key features with minimal loss of information.
### Supervised Learning:
Implemented algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Lasso Regression.
Achieved RÂ² > 0.99 on noisy datasets, demonstrating robustness.
### Unsupervised Learning:
Clustering algorithms include K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Time-Series K-Means.
Hierarchical Clustering achieved high silhouette scores for group detection.
### Time-Series Analysis:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify temporal data with ~97% accuracy across datasets.
